Key Insights:
1. Fertilizer recommendations are most strongly influenced by: Fertilizer_Recommended(kg/ha), Soil_pH, Humidity(%)
2. Wheat crops require the most soil moisture on average
3. For crops experiencing temperatures above 30Â°C, recommended actions:
   - Increase irrigation frequency
   - Monitor soil moisture more frequently
   - Consider shade solutions for heat-sensitive crops

Recommendations:
- Implement dynamic fertilizer adjustments based on Fertilizer_Recommended(kg/ha)
- Group irrigation schedules by crop type and temperature ranges
- Install additional sensors in Wheat fields for better monitoring
